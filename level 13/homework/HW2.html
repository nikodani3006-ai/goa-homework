     <h1>Yamaha Wr155 R</h1>
          <img src="images/wr-155-angle_720x540.avif" alt="Motorcycle" width="750">
     <h1>What kind of bike it is</h1>
          <p>The WR155R is a dual-sport / off-road oriented motorcycle built by Yamaha. That means it’s designed to be ridden both on unpaved (trail, dirt) roads and on tarmac.</p>
          <p>The “WR” name in Yamaha’s lineup typically stands for “wide‐ratio” gearbox versions (good for both low speed/off-road and higher speed/road).</p>
          <p>Specifically, the WR155R is a smaller displacement version (~155 cc) making it more accessible than larger adventure bikes.</p>
     <h1>Key technical attributes</h1>
         <ul>
             <li>Engine: 155 cc, single‐cylinder, 4-stroke, liquid‐cooled, with fuel injection and Yamaha’s VVA (Variable Valve Actuation) system for improved power delivery.</li>
             <li>Transmission: 6‐speed manual gearbox (which is somewhat unusual for many bikes in this size/class) offering more flexibility.</li>
             <li>Chassis & suspension: A semi-double cradle steel frame. Long-travel front forks and a suitable rear suspension for rough terrain. High ground clearance and tall seat height to suit off-road riding.</li>
             <li>Wheels/tyres: Typically large front wheel (21″) and rear wheel (18″) which is a common sizing in dirt/dual bikes for better handling of rough surfaces</li>
         </ul>
     <h1>What it’s for</h1>
          <p>It’s meant for riders who want more than just a city commuter or purely road-bike: it gives you the freedom to explore unpaved roads, forest tracks, trails — as well as being street legal and capable of normal road use.
             It’s targeted at those who want a balanced machine: not a massive heavy adventure bike, but something lighter, more nimble, with off-road credentials — but still usable in daily or mixed conditions.
              Because of its size (~155 cc), it’s less intimidating, great for intermediate riders or those who want a trail-capable bike without going into high-cc territory.
          </p>
     <h1>What to keep in mind</h1>
         <ul>
             <li>The tall seat height (around 880 mm) makes it quite “tall” compared to many street bikes — may be a challenge for shorter riders.</li>
             <li>Fuel tank capacity is modest (8.1 litres in some markets) so its range may be more limited than road bikes with bigger tanks. </li>
             <li>Its design and gearing suit off-road bias, so while it works fine on road, it might not offer the same comfort levels at high highway speeds or long touring as dedicated road bikes.</li>
             <li>Availability and service/support depend on market—since dual‐sport bikes sometimes have different distribution than mainstream street bikes.
             If you like, I can pull up detailed specs (complete numbers) and also how it compares to alternatives in the 150–200 cc dual-sport segment. Would you like that?

     <h1>📍 Considerations for Georgia / local market</h1>
          <ul>
             <li>Check import availability, local dealer network for parts & service.</li>
             <li>Consider tyres suited for your local terrain (if many unpaved roads, dual-sport tyres are good).</li>
             <li>Ensure the tall seat height is manageable for you (try sitting on one first).</li>
             <li>Check what the local pricing, registration, insurance and any taxes are for this model.</li>
             <li>Consider accessory cost (off-road gear, protective parts) if you plan serious off-road.</li>
          </ul>

 <h2>The Hellcat Redeye is a high-performance version of Dodge’s Challenger, taking the Hellcat concept even further.
     It bridges between the Hellcat and the ultra-limited Demon.
     It uses many of the Demon’s components and upgrades to boost power, torque, and performance</h2>
 
 
     <h2>At full throttle, it burns a lot of fuel; economy suffers when driven hard.</h2>
      

<h3>These are heavy cars. Their size and weight affect handling; though the widebody helps grip, it doesn’t magically make it ultralight.</h3>

 <h3>High purchase price, maintenance, insurance, tires, etc. Everything is more expensive when you’re dealing with ~800 hp.</h3>


 <h3>Loud, aggressive, sort of “raw” in feel. Great for showing off, drag strips, some road courses; less ideal if you want a smooth daily driver or something very refined.</h3>

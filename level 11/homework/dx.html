  <h1>🧠 Core Premise</h1>
     <p>Dexter Morgan, a forensic blood-spatter analyst for the Miami Metro Police Department, who hides a dark secret: he’s also a serial killer.
     However, he lives by a strict moral code (taught by his adoptive father, Harry Morgan) — he only kills other murderers who have escaped justice.</p>

  <h1>What is dexter about</h1>
      <p>Dexter is an American crime drama television series that originally aired on Showtime from 2006 to 2013, later revived in 2021 with Dexter: New Blood.
         It follows Dexter Morgan, a forensic blood-spatter analyst working for the Miami Metro Police Department who secretly leads a double life as a serial killer. What sets Dexter apart from other murderers is that he lives
          by a strict moral code instilled in him by his adoptive father,
          Harry Morgan — a police officer who recognized Dexter’s homicidal urges early on and taught him to channel them into something “constructive.” According to Harry’s Code, Dexter kills only
         those who have themselves committed murder and escaped justice. This premise turns the show
         into a darkly ironic exploration of morality, identity, and the blurred line between justice and vengeance.</p>

     <h2>Dexter is both</h2>
         <p>On one hand, Dexter does terrible things — he kills people, lies constantly, and endangers those around him. By any legal or moral standard, he’s a murderer. Even though his victims
             are often killers themselves, Dexter doesn’t
             present him as a traditional hero; the show never fully excuses his actions. He kills because of an internal compulsion — what he calls his Dark Passenger — 
             not simply out of a sense of justice. That makes him dangerous and, in many ways, a villain.</p>
     
         <p>But on the other hand, Dexter has a code — a moral framework given to him by his adoptive father, Harry, which restricts his violence to “bad” people: 
            other murderers who escaped justice. The show uses this to create moral tension:
             is it better to let evil people go free, or worse to become evil yourself while stopping them? Many viewers see Dexter as a kind of antihero — 
             someone who does horrific things, but for reasons we can partly understand, even sympathize with.</p>
